# Rust Basics (Mehrad's Journey To Learn Rust)

### Hello
Trying to learn Rust and this a directory to store my hello worlds (or to-do lists? if that was something people would write program with Rust) and documents here.
I'll seperate directories based on days first and then based on projecets, so I (or maybe later you) can see the progress. 

### What are the sources?

`// TODO`
